Optional Parts
----

The parts below are optional, but having them will make your build easier and much cleaner. Without these parts, you could connect all of the pieces above with wire and solder them all together. Using the parts below, you'll be able to construct a board that all of your fans and your Arduino will plug into.

The build guide will assume you have the optional parts. If not, it's pretty easy to figure out how to omit them. 

* 5.5mm DC power jack - [link](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N5TW8P5/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03__o00_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
