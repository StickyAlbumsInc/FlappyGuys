Flappy Guys
==============

This repo contains the source code, materials list, STL files, patterns, and instructions for creating and assembling a group of 5 IR controlled, miniature "flappy guys," more boringly referred to as "air dancers" or "windsock people."

These guys, but small:

The inspiration for this project came about during a team meeting in which we lamented how loud and ineffective (and not remote controlled) current miniature "flappy guys" on the market are. We knew we could do it better! So this became a thing. Here is that thing.

The parts can add up, but many of them are things you'll probably have on hand already, if you work with Arduino. Many of the links on the parts are for bulk buying options, which gives you a little more up-front cost but a much lower cost-per-unit. If you plan to make a hobby out of Arduino, it's worth the investment, as these are common parts you will likely use often (header pins, DC jacks, solderable breadboards, etc.). 

It also helps if you have access to a 3D printer to print a shroud for each fan in your final build. If you can't 3D print one, you will need to fabricate a similar shroud in some fashion. There are a number of ways this could be done and some of those will be discussed in the build guide.
